# FireFighterRobot
This project showcases a prototype firefighting robot designed to detect and respond to fire hazards autonomously. Powered by an Arduino Uno, the robot integrates IR fire sensors to locate flames, a water pump and relay system for targeted water spray, and an L298N motor driver to control mobility.
